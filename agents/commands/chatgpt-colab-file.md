description: Use pw to have an agent-to-ChatGPT discussion using an existing file for ChatGPT's context, e.g. a codemap file. Requires the pw skill.
---

Use the pw skill, connect to chatgpt.com using headful browser, upload $1 as attachment file, discuss and get feedback from ChatGPT. The attachment is only for the purpose of giving ChatGPT more context. Discuss strategy and a full plan for continued development of $2. Ask if ChatGPT needs further code detail in any specific areas that they want to look at to provide better guidance. You can switch between checking real code and talking to chatgpt, be colaborative, have a few back-and-forths. When wrapping up, ask ChatGPT for a comprehensive multi-phased plan with checkboxes to fill and code sketches. Synthesize this full plan to disk as a .md file. Strip out any references to time frames (e.g. days/weeks to complete) in the final document.
